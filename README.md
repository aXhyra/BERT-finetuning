# Finetuning DistilBERT for sentiment analysis on tweets
## Advanced Topics in Machine Learning, 2021. 
### Marco Latella, Pietro Tropeano, Alind Xhyra



The focus of this project is to fine-tune a DistilBERT  model over 4 different classification tasks on the tweet-eval dataset.
 
To perform the experimental phase, 3 different helper classes were created. It is possible to find such classes in the helper folder.
- Service helper, to handle the login process in the used services 
- Dataset helper, to load and work with different datasets
- Engine helper, to perform optimization and training on the chosed models
